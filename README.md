## Optimization

Before optimizing, the loss after 50 epochs was .55, and the accuracy was .73. The goal of optimizing was to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75%. 

The steps taken to optimize the model included:



Adjusting the input data to ensure that there are no variables or outliers that are causing confusion in the model, such as:
Dropping more or fewer columns.
Creating more bins for rare occurrences in columns.
Increasing or decreasing the number of values for each bin.
Adding more neurons to a hidden layer.
Adding more hidden layers.
Using different activation functions for the hidden layers.
Adding or reducing the number of epochs to the training regimen.
